### GameScriptHub - OpenComputers Lua scripts

This repository provides various ready-to-use scripts for your OpenComputers systems.
To use OPPM for installation / updates just add the repository with this command:

```
oppm register https://github.com/GameScriptHub/OpenComputers
```

**Note** that this is not an official repository and you'll use these scripts on your own risk.

## Available packages

Here's a list of all currently available packages.

# DeepResonanceController

The DeepResonanceController will take care of enabling / disabling your DeepResonance generator. It also provides useful information about the current status of the generator, e.g. stored energy, remaining lifetime of connected crystals, etc. For more information consider the [README](https://github.com/GameScriptHub/OpenComputers/tree/master/DeepResonanceController) of the respective package. Since this script has some configuration that has to be done *before* the script can be used you should really have a look at the README.

Installation: `oppm install deepresonance-controller`

Updating: `oppm update deepresonance-controller`
